This is the place I'll add some additional commentary to the collection of apps you'll find on my github profile. Starting with [it-does-stuff](https://github.com/danengle/it-does-stuff).

I'm not entirely sure how it's all going to get out there, but I have a decent idea and figured I just needed to start putting it out there and see how it goes.

The general idea is that this little blog will provide a linear timeline of events that will bounce among more than one project depending on what I decide is important at the time.

And what is that you may be asking yourself...

Well, what started as, "I'll just learn some React now" because I wanted to build a [Heroes of the Storm](https://heroesofthestorm.blizzard.com/en-us/) style team draft app. Haven't played the game for a long time now, but I did spend quite a lot of time playing it. This seemed much more interesting than your standard blog app and ended up leading me all over the place. I learned quite a lot and all that info was pulled from so many different places and things were hardly ever quite as easy as the original authors said they would be.

So I decided I should roll that all up and contribute back and hopefully help some folks learn some things and prevent at least one additional forehead banging out of frustration event. The end goal now is actually a video playlist player thing like Youtube.

No guarantees, but you know, it's the thought that counts and all that.

The things getting put together as of now are...
- [Gitea](https://about.gitea.com/) server (yes, I fully understand this is funny because Github right here).
- Public key infrastructure setup so you can create certs for nodes on your network. I settled on using [Smallstep](https://smallstep.com/docs/step-ca/). 
- [Docker registry](https://hub.docker.com/_/registry) for Gitea server workflows.
- Video player web app with a [NextJS](https://nextjs.org/) frontend and [Rails](https://rubyonrails.org/) backend.

There are a lot more details to those so if you've found yourself here and there aren't any links anywhere, you'll just have to be patient.

I have most of the content needed for all of these things, I just didn't have a great way thought out to present it all in a coherent manner. Still probably don't, guess we'll find out.

Also, just to be clear...

I'm not presenting anything as "This is the way you should be doing this", or "Here are the 4 options you have and you have to decide what works for you best (while not really providing a full picture of any single option)".

I'm presenting it as, "This is what I decided to do to make things work the way I wanted them to and this is why". I'll explain why, question myself, provide any relevant gotchas you may want to consider, but the bottom line is any info you find here should be taken as building blocks, not a final design or solution.

And that was a lot of rambling and I have more I want to add, but I'll stop for now.

Stay tuned for more.
